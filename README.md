# youtube-music-like-button

This is a simple Python script to solve a simple problem I had with Youtube Music.  I wanted a way to hit the like button on a song while I was doing something in another window.  This script will essentially automate alt-tabbing to your browser with Youtube Music, toggle the like button (it will unlike a song if used on a song already liked), and then quickly tab back to the window you were already on.  Spotify has a nice API you can interact with to do this, but Youtube is lacking a formal API, so this is the solution I use.

This process is fairly seamless and takes only a few milliseconds.  I'll use it when I'm gaming usually.  If your game is running in windowed mode this works really well.  I do recommend having your browser on another monitor so you don't get anything flashing over your game window even for a few moments.  This will still work if you are on one monitor, but it will be a little annoying.

There are a few planned features as TODOs in my code, but if you like this and want anything else added let me know and I'll take a crack at it.
